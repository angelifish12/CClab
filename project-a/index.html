                    Locals warned: "don't lift the rock!" but they did... and found a group of tiny, black, spiky creatures
                    with two bright eyes. The creatures stayed together and watched every move. When
                    startled, they bounced so high they seemed to vanish. In the dim lab, the team studied them, until a
                    sudden bright flash sent the creatures under their favorite rock—and a small opening appeared. One
                    bounced into the opening and disappeared...</div>

                Puffypuffs move in clusters, never straying into solitude; if you see one, you're seeing many. Daylight
                unsettles them, so they retreat to
                shadowed nooks—most often tucked beneath rocks or any handy cover. Curious and playful, they'll engage
                with unfamiliar beings
                , hovering at the edge of reach like timid playmates. Their bodies are tiny and quick; a sudden bounce
                can launch them out of sight so fast
                that a blink means you've missed them. And wherever you stand, they will always look at you your every
                small shift.
                <br>
                <span class="pinky">Guidelines for human interaction with Puffypuff:</span> Move slowly and stay in
                the shade. Puffypuffs feel safest out of direct sunlight;
                if you keep to shadowed areas, they'll linger. Their gaze will track your every shift.
                Approach with soft steps. When alarmed, they may swell their spikes
                and shift color; pause and give them space until they settle.
                Let them come to you. They're tiny, but they return when the air feels calm again.
                <br>Caution: no flash and DO NOT press the space key!
